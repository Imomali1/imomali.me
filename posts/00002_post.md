## My First Steps with TypeScript

I’ve always written JavaScript without types, but after joining a project that used **TypeScript**, I had to learn it fast. At first, it felt overwhelming—why do I need to define types for everything? But after a week, I started to see the benefits.

### What I’ve Learned So Far

1. **Fewer Bugs**: Catching errors at compile time is a game-changer.
2. **Better Autocomplete**: My editor (VS Code) now feels like it’s reading my mind.
3. **Interfaces**: They make my code so much cleaner and reusable.

Here’s a quick example of something I wrote:

```typescript
interface Post {
  title: string;
  date: string;
  slug: string;
  content: string;
}

const myPost: Post = {
  title: "Learning TypeScript",
  date: "2025-03-12",
  slug: "learning-typescript",
  content: "This is my blog post!",
};
