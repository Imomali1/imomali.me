## Why I Started Using Next.js

I’ve been a web developer for a few years, mostly working with plain React. Recently, I decided to give **Next.js** a try after hearing so much about its features like static site generation and server-side rendering. Honestly, I was blown away by how easy it was to set up a project and get started.

### What I Love About It

- **File-based Routing**: No more messing with React Router. Just drop a file in the `app` directory, and it’s a route!
- **Built-in CSS Support**: With Tailwind CSS, styling became a breeze.
- **Static Generation**: Perfect for a blog like this one.

I built this blog in just a few hours, and I’m excited to keep exploring Next.js. Have you tried it yet? Let me know your thoughts!
